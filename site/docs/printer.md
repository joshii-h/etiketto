# Printer and troubleshooting

## Wi-Fi setup { #wifi }

Etiketto does not set up Wi-Fi. Use a phone or the printer's web interface
once:

1. Hold the Wi-Fi button until it turns from blue to white.
2. Connect phone or computer to the open network "Brother VC-500W…".
3. Open `https://192.168.0.1` (accept the certificate warning) or Brother's
   Color Label Editor app.
4. Choose your network and enter the password. Only 2.4 GHz, WPA or open.

Later, the web interface is at `https://` and the printer's address:
"Network Wi-Fi Setup" changes the network (or "click here" to enter it by
hand), "AirPrint Options" sets name, location and firmware updates.

## Cassettes

| Cassette | Width |
|---|---|
| CZ-1001 | 9 mm (3/8″) |
| CZ-1002 | 12 mm (1/2″) |
| CZ-1003 | 19 mm (3/4″) |
| CZ-1004 | 25 mm (1″) |
| CZ-1005 | 50 mm (2″) |

Etiketto shows the inserted cassette, remaining tape, printable width, lot
number and the presumed production date. ZINK paper ages: old paper prints
paler and yellowish, Etiketto warns about old cassettes. Store cassettes cool
and dry.

Cleaning: insert the cleaning cassette CK-1000, cleaning starts by itself.
Do it when stripes appear, or every 20 to 30 labels.

## Problems

- [[ui:No printer found]]: printer on and in the same network? The search
  needs the Avahi service (installed on most desktops, any init system);
  systemd-resolved alone resolves `.local` names but cannot search. Otherwise
  enter the address under [[ui:Host name or IP address]].
- [[ui:Printer not reachable]]: check the address, the printer may have a new
  IP. Switch the printer off and on again.
- [[ui:Wrong cassette]]: the label was designed for another width. Change
  [[ui:Tape width]] or the cassette.
- [[ui:No cassette inserted]] or cassette not recognised: reinsert the
  cassette until it clicks.
- No paper: the cassette is empty, replace it.
- Paper jam: open the cover, remove the jammed label, reinsert the cassette.
- Cover open: close the cover.
- Warming up, cooling down, cleaning: wait, printing continues by itself.
- Swipe the panel to cut: the label was printed without cut, swipe across the
  panel.
- Pale colours, yellow tint: old paper (see the cassette's age), or
  [[ui:Normal]] instead of [[ui:Vivid]]. With old cassettes try
  [[ui:Brightness]] −1 to −3 under [[ui:Colour adjustment]].
- Background barely visible: ZINK hardly prints very light pastel shades,
  choose a medium shade.
- Stripes: clean with the CK-1000.
- Content cut off at the edge or askew: increase the [[ui:Safety margin]],
  insert the cassette straight.
- [[ui:content scaled down to fit]]: the fixed length is too short. Make it
  longer or use [[ui:Automatic length]].

Something else? [[ui:Report a problem…]] in the main menu (also offered with
error messages) opens a prefilled issue in the browser with version, system
and printer. You see everything before sending it.
